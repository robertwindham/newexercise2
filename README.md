# Guinea Pigs and their need for Vit C

This is practice for pushing R content onto Github. I will be using the built in dataset "ToothGrowth" from my previous exercise since I do not have my own thesis project.

Deprivation of Vitamin C from the diet of Guinea Pigs can cause the teeth to cease growing. Testing the effects of varying doses of vitamin c administered per day through orange juice and Ascorbic acid, it was found that tooth growth in Guinea Pigs is positively correlated to Vitamin C dosage.

This repository includes an R markdown file coding the results of the data, html files showing the results of the data, an images folder, the R project file, and a '.gitignore' file included in the R code.
